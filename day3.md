## What we did
* Today we went through loops in class 
  * for
  * while
  * do while


## thoughts
Honestly "learned" is a bit of an overstatement. We went through them very quickly, getting a super short and IMO incomplete example for each. 
If I hadn't spent the last 8 months or so messing around with code and loops I wouldn't have been as screwed as some of the other classmates. I guess I shouldn't feel too bad as it was a big part of the javacript tutorials, but still I think the lecture was pretty insufficient for the amount that everyone had to do. Can't really blame Allie either as there just isn't much time (except for the examples, those could have been better).

It's getting brutal, the amount of work we have to do. I haven't worked this hard/long in a long long time. It isn't really that what we're doing is hard (yet), it's more that there is an absolute ton of it. I think we're going to see the fatigure in the quality of reading assignments and posts that are submitted to our 'discussion'.

## Gratefulness exercise
1. To have miranda who is very supportive and loving throughout this and gives very good good morning goodbyes when I leave.
2. That I'm beginning to meet more people here. I see the other students in 301 and 401 have such comeraderie and I can start to see that happeneing among us.
3. My lunch tasted effin real good.
4. Trivia Last night was super bomb! Such good food and fun.
5. That I'm going to have finished so much of my work today before I go home! And for the impending dinner : ) That's exciting and should be fun to socialize.

## Goals for Tomorrow
1. keep up 
2. feel better physically
3. ask more questions of the TAs and Allie
