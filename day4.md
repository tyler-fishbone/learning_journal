## Thoughts

Ok first things I'll say is that today was sooooo much better than yesterday it's crazy. I just feel way better.

I think part of that was today felt like the begining of the ice breaking between our class. The pair programming was a lot of fun, being able to socialize and work on things together, even learn from one another!

I had a good time with Steve, learning about his past from his About Me project. That guy has had a wild life. 

I think the full combination of lecture, lunch, collaboritive work, and then individual work is most enjoyable.

The subject matter today (besides git stuff) was a review as I've been doing loops for a while, but seeing classmates use them helped solidify them a lot in my mind.

## Gratitude

1. Grateful for the lunch hang out with a couple classmates today
2. Grateful for mirandas text. Geting through this will take a new level of honesty but I believe it's possible.
3. Peer Programming existing and being an actual part of the workflow in orgs, that's too cool!
4. Allie's patience and lack of ego when she makes small mistakes while teaching, I'm super impressed with how she handles errors. I want that!
5. 960 css rule. I love that there are grids for design like that. There truly is hope for me.
