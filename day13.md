## What We Learned
* Local Storage

## Thoughts

Today was a great day for collaboration and validation in thinking.

I worked myself for a while with the assignment to store and use information with local storage and got pretty far like that. I overheard folks saying that the TAs were telling people to do it the way that I did initially which is cool.

Event better though was after I finished I spent time talking people though how I did it, and then worked with two others (Beverly and Carl) to figure out a problem we were all happening. I'm happy I plucked up the courage to approach people. This really is often a collaborative thing to do. It was such a high too! Figuring out that issue with the single bars in the graph displaying! Felt so good!
