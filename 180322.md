## Learned today
* how to properly use the Python lambda function
* about the sorted, map, and filter functions
* the Python class
* write better test suites by abstracting reusable objects into fixtures

## Thoughts
A great leap!
Shannon and I cruised forward today in a big way. Completed lab 3, save whatever the TAs say of course he he he erg... But twas good. Try: Except is making way more sense. The whole raise exception thing still does not make sense to be, but I have to be happy with the win.

Super pumped the CSV thing is working. Scripting in general is such an exciting thing. Really is the computer doing work for me instead of the other way around.

But on to the real excitement for today: The Meeting with Marc! dun dun dunnnnn

Went really well. I feel like I clarified a lot of questions I had about dev ops and data science, got muuuuch more comfortable talking about myself and my past and the big one... he asked when I would be done and to let him know when that happened! So great! Clear sign of approval and interest. Really all that I could hope for.

Especially great was how well recieved my past experience was. He loved that I got my hands dirty is so many things. That side projects were the way to go. Demonstrate a passion. That's what it's all about. I don't really have much time to do that now, but one day I will. Now is still about honing skills.

Yeah, just really great. Gotta thanks Lara again.
