## Thoughts

Wooo doggy that was a day. I got my code working pretty fast I think and then attempted to hit a stretch goal. It took me a while (and a much needed typo check from allie) but I got there! Very proud to have that bottom row printing totals. Next step is getting the cell on the bottom right to print the total cookies sold in all.

Even more proud though is the fact that I helped 3 of my classmates today. Allie at the meeting said that I was doing well, one of the stronger students, and that I showed a capacity for leadership and should exercise it by helping out classmates. I'm pleased to say that I did give Forrest, Jose and Patricia help today. Sadly I could really figure out patricias thing but she said I gave her some new ideas. Jose and Forrest though I was able to figure out what the issue was by going through their code with them. Feels great : )
