# Monday March 26th

## Learned Today
* basic understanding of the use cases and capabilities of the Python NumPy Package.
* aggregate data analytics from a data set or sets.
* learn to utilize a Jupyter Notebook for processing and managing their data research.

## Thoughts
This'll be a quickie cause It's 8:30 and I'm still here.

This stuff today was tough. Using 2 libraries and jupyter notebook for the first time was loco. I think I would have drowned if I didn't join up with Patricia and Brandon. Changed Everything. Remember that for the next time I'm underwater.

## Gratitude
* the difference between suffering and pain is suffering happens when you're alone
* light at the end of tunnels
* hard work
* the mentors who came in today to speak with me
