## Thoughts
The day with brandy was good. A little TMI with her, but by the end it turned out to be fun. 

It's such a change from the normal firehose of information that the second she starts talking about personal stuff I start to get a little like 'ergggg', I just want to learn stuff and nothing else. But it's who she is.

The exercises were good. I think I did well with the interviews. Brandy told me that my interview is so much more impressive than my resume. I need to bring my resume up to match it. Much more powerful.
