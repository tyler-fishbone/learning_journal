## Learned Today
* difference between a library and a web framework
* basic familiarity with the Pylons Project Pyramid Web Framework

## Thoughts today
Light work load today (which is nice). Allowed me more time to really do my whiteboard well and thing deeply about the best/most interesting way to solve it. That's not something I've felt like I've had the luxury of doing recently.

Well timed talk with Sooz. I have been in a pretty bad place recently and I'd like to turn that around. I'm not always going to be the best at everything. Limiting myself to doing things where that is true is doing just that. Limiting myself.

Feel a little guilty about going to this movie now. I've got all my work done, but I know I could spend the time to go deeper on some things. But I'd like to have guilt be a smaller part of my life so why don't we say that since what I'm doing isn't hurting anyone that it's probably ok.

## Gratutude
* honest friends
* family to celebrate passover with
* rubber ducking brent
* that I'm not being chinese water tortured
