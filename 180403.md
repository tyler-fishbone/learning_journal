## Learned Today
* how to fully deploy Django applications using the AWS ecosystem

## Thoughts
Today was alright. I had a good amount of fun but it didn't feel like we learned a ton. The setup for AWS has felt like we're just going through the motions, not that we're really learning something. Maybe it always feel like this with a tool. I don't know, but it feels like we were pushing crazy hard and fast before and now it's let up, which while nice mentally doesn't feel like a super awesome utilization of time.

Super glad however to have scotts quick setup video for AWS that was super duper helpful and I'm very glad that I'll have that for project week as well as after I graduate!
