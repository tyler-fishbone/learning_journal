## Thoughts
Arg today was hard. I spent a ton of time (relative to past days) refactoring my code from the day before. After about 3 hours of work I'd gotten up to the standard of Allie's from todays demo. Translating my code was a taxing exercise but a good one. it was like the guy Mike for the operation code meet up said, debugging other peoples code is good experience. It wasn't someone elses code but it was still new enough to talk a while to wrap my head around. 

I finally got it working and moved onto the chart. I went pretty quickly to using the example that Jeremy posted. It was a frustrating experience because of how new it was. I felt like I was blindly poking at stuff to see what it would do, especially with the charts properties. There were just so many brackets and indents, it got super confusing super quickly. 

Afterwards I went to the Operation Code meetup with Jeremy and Forrest, Mario was there as well. Besides the slight awkwardness of me not being a veteran it was interesting enough. A lot more pounding of how important networking and good coding practices are. Nothing super new but reinforcing good stuff. Most importantly that people are happy for you to connect with them and will likely try to help you.

I want to try and hang out socially with some of my classmates. We're (i'm) lacking the fun that could be had. Plus initial awkward hangouts are fun : )

## Gratitude
* that even communities that I don't necessarily belong to will accept me
* Forrest being an energetic and kind guy
* The relationships I'm beginning to make with people
* An industry that has so many resources available
* our new deebot!
