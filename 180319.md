## Thoughts
###IT IS HERREEEEEE!###
The day I've been waiting for. The day the magic begins to become truly mine.

I cannont express how happy I am about being in this class right now. I was in such ~~pain~~ suffering about what 401 I should go into and I never felt like I was able to give a real reason why my gut was telling me python. I still don't feel like I can articulate it, but I can now say that YES, yes indeed this was right. I'm going to learn how to become one with my computer. Talk to it and work with it to perform some truly bad ass magic.

Scott is great (scott if you're reading this don't let it go to your head). I'm very down with his work hard and enjoy it attitude. Also the class is filled with such bright people! The questions today were good ones and I felt comfortable asking mine. PP with Shannon went really well, we have a good vibe.

I just get the sense that we are truly going to be learning how to use **tools** here. I love how serious Scott takes this class and how grueling it will be. Bring it fucking on.

## Gratitude
