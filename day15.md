## Thoughts
Project week begins!

We had our last class today and now we have our groups and have a project to work on! There was a bit of shifting around but now it seems we've got a good group. It'll be interesting to see how it all develops once we have disagreements, but for a first day I think we did well.

We'll be doing a whack a mole game which was harom's idea. I'm glad I didn't pitch one as I have a tendency to get too emtionally invested in my own ideas and then can't waver when people disagree.

Computer still doesn't work which is a bummer but I'm very glad too have this baby back, she is working super duper well and I love her. it'll be quite a weekend.

## Gratitude
* Sooz, staying after to work with Zachary and help me with my resume. What a mensch
* Times of excitement and enthusiasm in the group
* an opportunity to work as a team
* the weekend
* that we're almost finished with this first session, wild! and we're about to build an entire game. Tis truly loco.
