## what we learned today
* MVC
* SQL - making requests

## Thoughts

Welp, brent and I fucked up that lab pretty hard. Not really sure how we didn't realize we were supposed to query the database but we didn't. Now that we filled them in it's working. Starting the think that for some reason we don't make a great programming pair.

But the lecture was great! I was really zoned in after that coffee and a good amount of what allie said during code review made sense. I definitely will have a hard time recreating it or explaining it from scratch but it felt like it was priming my brain well for the future work.

I cannot wait for when I'm able to visualize the MVC workings as well as what the database looks like. That is going to be amazing, really another world.

I'm glad to have patricia as a partner for tomorrow, she's got a good attitude and asks good questions.

## Gratitude
* that sarah and chase trust us enough to argue in front of us
* allie and her lecture today, the random student asker is so good! We should really make her a button tho...
* the last night with my girl! I was tired today, but it's worth it tonight as well to make sure she gets a good send off. Coffee it shall be again.
* Databases in the first place, damn things rock.
* I'm really grateful that there is always going to be more to learn and leverage in this field. Always be learning baby.
