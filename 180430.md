## Thoughts
The glowforge is finally mine!! I've got it home and I'm pumped to start making stuff with it.

Today was good. Really liked doing the whiteboard myself and talking it out in that classroom. Testing... well I wouldn't call it fun but it wasn't too bad.

I know AWS is going to be a bitch and a half but I'm excited anyway to start getting those skills!
