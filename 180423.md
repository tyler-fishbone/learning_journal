# Monday April 23rd

## Learned Today
* how to implement a data model in Django
* what a database migration is and how migrations control the relationship between the database and the app
* how to reliably test a Django app

## Thoughts
 Django rocks. miles clearer than Pyramid. Things feel a lot more sensical which I'm wildly happy about and grateful for. Working with BRandon is suepr awesome. He's very patient, we're a good match for skill level, and he seems more interested in learning that just getting this stuff done. Very happy with how that turned out.

 K-ary trees were another small mind blow. Def felt the tingles in class. These datastructures things are like taking a drug sometimes.
