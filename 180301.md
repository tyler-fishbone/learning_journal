## Thoughts
Laides and gentlebuzzards, the fatigue is real. 

I am super effing tired. The workload is starting to get to me. I'm still able to do things, but I dont feel like I ever have time for a break. I basically have my commute. Is this what being a parent is like?  Oh no.

Despire all this lab went not horribly, for the first time today we didn't finish our functionality by the end of the day. We got the delete button to work and the update form to show up when you're in the detail view. You get a 404 when you try to submit changes and there is no admin privledges, but still, not terrible for this morning's work. Jeremy and I are still working well enough together. No yelling or anything. I just wish I had some time off. Like I don't even think the break is going to be a break. w/e. I'm just complaining now.
