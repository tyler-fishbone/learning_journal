## Learned Today
* both sides of the "coding interview" process
* basic use case and implementation of a stack data structure
* basic use case and implementation of a queue data structure

## Thoughts
Just got out of good meeting with BJ about Leafly. Office looked super cool and obviously it would be fascintating to work for a place centered around advocacy for a substance I think is so rad. I think I was a bit 'I'm so cool' about code fellows with a couple folks, but it's ok. One thing I've learned is that people don't knock others for that as much as I think. And even when they do it's really only in the moment.

Class was good. Stacks and Queues seem a bit wierd and un applicable just like linked lists were, but they'll come with time. Whiteboarding went ok. Def not a slam dunk, but not a whiff either. Just need more pracitce.

## Gratitiude
* Miranda is home now! That's really all that matters.
