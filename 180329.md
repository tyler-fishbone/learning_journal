## Learned Today
* purpose of unsupervised classification
* use of k-means algorithm
* pros and cons of k-NN algorithm
* pitfalls of these algorithms and means of avoiding them

## Thoughts
More machine learning today
Again conceptual stuff was good. I felt like I was following Boris's lecture fairly well. The implementation during the lab went so-so, defnintely felt like I was just going through the motions a bit.
But talking with Patricia about Genetic Iteration as a technique in opposition to deep learning was waay interesting. It seems like a way to create wildly new things, where deep learning seems to just be a bunch of hyper automation of human skills.

## Gratitude
* Miranda comes home tomorrow!
* guest lecturers
* getting out early!
* getting our early again!
