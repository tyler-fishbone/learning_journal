## Learned Today
* basic understanding of common sorting algorithms, and their unique use cases
* differences between space and time complexity of algorithms

## Thoughts
Today was a bit of a dud school wise. I'm out here on alki doing the mergsort and honestly having a nice time, but I'm paying money for this and it really feels like it could just be done on my own time or over weekend. This should have been a small lecture on friday or thursday and then a weekend assignment. It wasn't enough lecture material for today. Kind of a waste.

Beyond that, mergesort is very cool. It's taken me like 5 straight hours to wrap my head around it (recursion just does not click immediately), but I feel pretty good now that I think I've got my head around an implementation. Now going to go on to selection sort.

## Gratitude
* cool as algorithms like this
* that I'll get to contribute to open source tools after this
* the sun of my face
* miranda being a total babe in the sun
* that sandwich, oh baby that sandwich
