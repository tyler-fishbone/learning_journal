## Learned Today
* Django Rest Framework

## Thoughts
Se√±oritis is officially here. Very difficult to stay on task, but coupled with that is the pleaseure and community of a team that's almost hit the finish line.

Rest framework stuff is cool and seems pretty dang easy in django. We'll see if it's something I actually get into using after I'm done.

Tried to do adams whiteboard solution. I thought I had it but then he came in and poked holes in it. Rough. Better now than in an interview though. Good ego check, just have to make sure I don't take it too far. Still need to keep up confidence.

Talked to shannon about chrome extension projects. He seemed pretty excited about them. He totally poked a hole in one of them which was actually rad. It changes the project and makes it cool in a different way. His idea about dimming the screen then the user isn't looking at it is pretty rad. He was also amped about using the laser cutter which we should totally do. Seems like we have similar interests.
