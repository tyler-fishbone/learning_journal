## Thoughts
Today we have a guest lecturer come to speak with us. Boris is a works in Machine Learning at Amazon and he lectured our class on the basics of machine learning. He was funny but intimidating and said 'no that's wrong' in a way only russians can seem to.

The conceptual topics of his lecture weren't too difficult to understand. Besides my unfmilirity of the concept of data as a 'vector' I think I followed pretty well.

When we got to lab however, what scott said to us before we started was definitely true. I do not feel like I could go back and do that again. I feel like maybe kind of I could describe to other people what I did, which maybe isn't bad.

In fact, this is not something I really feel like I'm going to go into as a job but it's wildly exciting to think about using real statistics to guide decision making. That would be awesome and this sort of shallow wade into ML should serve to demystify it a bit.

Linked List merge went PLBLBLBLBLB (calvin and hobbes speak for that thing with your tounge where you blow out while its outside you mouth and it makes a 'pooting' sound). I ate it on that and only came close to finishing because of help from others.

I've got resubmits to do but I'm just too tired.
