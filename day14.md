## Thoughts
I effin cleaned up at the end baby. getting those objects reinstantiated on a **separate** javascript file for the cart page was absolutely amazing. Shout out to Mike who give me the knowledge to make it happen. Feels fucking great!

Pair programming went well enough. Michael and I did the home page together which was good for each of us. I benefited from slowing down and having his point of view in error catching and ideas. We're at pretty different skill levels so that made a it a little hard. I wanted to start running a good amount of the time, but it didn't feel appropriate. Finally did at the end and exploded with some awesome stuff.

Allie told us about 301 today, I am super duper pumped for it! mobile optomization, labs in the morning, it's the best of both worlds in my mind. Cannot **wait** to start doing more API work. That is truly leveraging resources that are out there.
