# Tuesday May 8th

## Learned Today

* Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Views (CBV) and how they work
* implementing orms into Django Imager apps

## Thoughts
Woof! That was quite a contrast to chill yetserday. The conversion from function based views to class based views was quite an ordeal. We definely got our hands dirty. Brandon and I are only now just finishing and it's 8:40 PM. Feels good to put in a hard day's work. Now off to implement quick sort.
