## Thoughts
Glory be to Jehovah we finished snakes cafe. It's kind of hard to believe but it's done.

I had a little bit of blow up over the whole O(n) vs 0(n^2) thing with Austen and Shannon. I'm still harboring a little anoyance over austen's saying that he could elp but write 9 tests for his whiteboarding when I hadn't even started mine yet. It just felt like bragging. I don't want to be the guy who takes every comment in comparison to his ego, but I guess I couldn't help it there. Then when the O(n) thing happened I was just like 'no, I'm going to be better about something'. Bleh it was gross.  i want to be able to have debates about programs without taking it personally.

Ok enough about that.

I'm starting to feel like Scott's lectures need a bit of an overhaul. He's teaching us theory first with everything and it's not helping. I learn best by seeing something in action first, especially when we're expected to use it immediately.

Don't write 'class BasicClass'. That's not helpful. Stick with the car example.
```'class Vehicle <-> subclass Sedan``` Something actually applicable. I'm not a CS person, I'm at a vocational school. I learn by getting my hands dirty and watching how things work, not talking to God about what He thinks a human might look like. I want to see a human.

I'm go into this more in feedback too, but that's gotta get better.
