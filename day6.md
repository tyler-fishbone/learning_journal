## Thoughts

Today's assignment on object modeling was challenging but went well. I was able to get the initial object literal for the salmon cookie stand working with no major major road blocks, only went to the TAs once for questions.

I had some debugging issues in the retyping of the object literal which help me up for a while, but I finally found it. A minCust_Hour vs minCust_hour... like seriously.

In the end the tables displayed well.

The CSS work on the page did not go so well. I got caught up doing parts that I think now were not that important. I think I could benefit from wire-framing the task next time and then trying to visualize that. It's almost like a Domain Modeling problem but with CSS and HTML. Tomorrow will be better. Maybe I make sure of the rubber ducky in the beginning instead of when I hace a problem.
