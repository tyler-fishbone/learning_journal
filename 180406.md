* how to configure a test suite for their function-based views in Pyramid

## Thoughts

Well I surely tested grit today. It's effing 12:30 pm and I still do not see how to do the tower of hanoi problem. I'm literally moving post it notes around on our coffee table with my girlfriend.

I need to sleep right now.

## Gratitiude
* That my gf is actually working on this with me
* pizza
* Adam
