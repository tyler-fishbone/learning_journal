## Thoughts
So after lecture I skedattled over to the UW so that I could avoid traffic in getting to the ROS meet up. We were assigned an assignment where we had to, between the hours of 1-5, recreate as best we could a website that Allie gave us. I liked the assignment first off because I love super well defined goals and then figuring out how to get there.

Allie in lecture though took us through her philosophy behind well structured CSS and it ended up being one of the most helpful things we've learned thusfar. She said to try and write CSS with as few Classes and IDs as possible which was not something I was doing before. I like IDs and classes because I felt I could tailor the names to each specific part and make it clearer. The opposite of course ended up ebing true, my css was a garbled mess of half thgouht through names that I didn't understand.

Instead using descendent selectors almost exclusivle allows me to visualize each of the elements inside of whatever box element it was in. It became much much easier to figure out whether I needed to style the box or it's contents, and since it went from top to bottom I didn't find myself scrolling like crazy. 

In the end I didn't use the 960 system. I used a reset so that I could define everything from scratch and went from there. I felt like a badass because the things for the most part did what I wanted. Also the deadline helped a ton in keeping me focused.

I was left with a project that I'm super proud of!
