## Learned Today
* four general relationships available in a Relational DBMS
* how relationships are built and managed within the Pyramid/SQLAlchemy environment

## Thoughts

Good lord almighty in tighty whitey's am I tired. Today would have been a lot, but didn't get started on the whiteboard of lab until 5PM because of that job call thing and our project group meeting. Call went well enough. It was just a recruiter, I definetly overprepared but w/e, that stuff will be good to have.

Tomorrow is going to be a slug day and I won't even think about Friday. In this current state having to talk about career stuff is, I think, going to cause me to lose whatever little sanity I had left.

## Gratitude
* This giant pineapple pillow next to me. It's the only one who really cares.
