## Learned Today:
* More DOM traversal
* jQuery!

## Thoughts
Working with Peter today rocked sauce! He's super pleasent and a smart dude, puts very little pressure on people in an annoying way. just really enjoyed the experience, much better than my other pairs so far.

Afternoon lectures are rufffff man. I wasn't tired with my body but my mind was just done so I don't feel like I got a ton from the final lecture. We'll see how much a difference that makes tomorrow.

I'm excited to do our lab tomorrow, because we're going to be learning a bunch of things that I'll be able to use for the rap app desktop version. oh man I really miss this. being able to crank on something (even my journal) without a partner allows my mind to relex and flow freely. This month will be a challenge in many ways! But we shall prevail.
