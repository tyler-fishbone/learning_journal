* about the services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* to provision a web server in AWS
* how to deploy a simple WSGI app to AWS

## Thoughts
Holy johnson it's already May 1st. I'm not ready to go out in the world yet. I'm scared. Man up Tyler. Ok.

AWS is a son of a bitch. It's not surprising though, when you consider that they really were the first people to make the elastic web services thing big. Its total spaghetti. But even still it works. It was wild to actually be SSHed into a piece of hardware somewhere off in oregon. Like it's a real computer like the pi. Actually probably very much like the pi.

I know it'll get easier to do this stuff with AWS, it's just going to be muslce memory (since jehovah knows theres very little sense to it). That will be a powerful feeling. To understand how to make a truly deploy sites. Real pro.

I'm getting ready for the end to come even despite the anxiety. I want to start building real stuff, especially real stuff of my own choosing. I don't have any time to do that now. I will once this ends. It'll be encouraged. Build stuff that people can use and I can show off to potential employers. Getting v ready for that.
