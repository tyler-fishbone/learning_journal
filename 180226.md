## Thoughts
Oh, hi there Imposter syndrome, didn't see you come in. Oh yes please take a seat right next to me and feel free to whisper things into my ear. Oh wow.. oh... oh god...

Yeah that's a little what today was like. For really the first time I felt like I was in the bottom half of the class in terms of understanding what we were doing in our lab today. I felt underqualified. I felt out of my depth. I felt shitty.

It's funny that I'd feel that way right after beginning 'The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck'. Just last night the words 'it's not what make you happy that defines you as a person, it's the particular pain that you're willing to put up with'. Today I felt pain. It brought about insecurity. But luckily I've been hammered with the idea that this feeling of inadequacy will happen. Not going to let it get to me. I know I can do this stuff. I can learn anything I need to. I am going to have these moment but it's up to me to ID them and enjoy them. I didn't get what was going on today, and that's alright. It's good, it means I'm being challenged. It means I'm human.

The stuff tho was very cool. IIFEs and modular functionality is pretty cool, I can tell we're talking off the training wheels and starting to allow ourselves the tools to leverage more functionality. I like that.

I think Jeremy and I are going to work well together. I can stand up to his masculine temper stuff. I don't mind that, I actually kind of enjoy getting a little rough. It'll be fun. I'm looking forward to th rest of this week.

Also that we're going to have such a stacked class in python. It's going to be such a wild array of skills. Kat if you're reading this I'm excited to be in a class with you. It's gonna necessitate an intense stepping up of that game. That'll be cool : )
