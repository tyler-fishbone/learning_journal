## Learned today
* deployment to heroku using CLI
* Travis CI

## Thoughts
I'm 10PM and I'm still here so I'll be breif. Neither today or yesterday we're 'light' days. Mutliple students and TAs all trying to debug one part of deployment today and still took fo eva. This week has made me not realy ever want to deploy my own site. Even simple ones are ridiculously complicated. I am kind of shocked. I'm sure in a few days I won't feel like this but for now jeezy cheezy.

## Gratitude
* a community of students
* pizza and thai food
* this potential job!
