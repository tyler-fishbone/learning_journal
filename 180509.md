## Learned Today
* front-end design patterns
* basics of working with a pre-processed style language such as Sass
* how to integrate pre-processed stylesheets into a Django project

## Thoughts
Good stuff today. Brian was great. Loved how much he was able to pack in to a relatively short lecture.

Testing was a pain in the patoot. CSS didn't go fast but we got a good amount of it working. It's just so apparent how much it helps if you plan out how you're going to do css beforehand. I knock us about that but there really just isn't time to do that well. There is just too much else to do. But the pictures in divs like on imgur look good. Proud of em.
