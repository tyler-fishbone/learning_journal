* More SQL
* MVC
* TOKEN

## Thoughts
Excited to the tokens! Something we store we shall use. muahaha.

Today went well. Jeremy and I worked on deploying the add a new article functionality to that site. I worked on the backend which, though there wasn't a ton to do, was good since I feel it's an area I haven't had much experience in. It was most fun at the end to try to figure out how we were going to be using the parameters. I almost had (a part of) it! But that abstract thinking was muy fun-o.

It was another day of feeling a bit lost an inadequate, but I think my mindset using that book has been helpful. I'm trying to pay attention to times when I'm relying on my desire to be better than others (like tyler, you're really good at this, which I can tell because you're doing better than other people, bleh. trying to get away from that). THis whole thing is turning into a very humbling experience. Now that I've glimpsed a bit of what it's like to be behind I'm much more humble about where I am.

Thought jeremy and I were going to get into a thing today but it never happened. We took a break and he ended up being more calm than I was expecting. Not 100% sure how it came about but I'm grateful for it. 

One thing I'd like to gte better at are the Kata's. My solutions definitely do not always work and it take a bunch of console logging to figure them out. In an interview I don't think I'll beable to do that as much. Working on it with people is good... but I think I'd rather trying talking and whiteboarding them out on my own. That'll have to be extra practice.
