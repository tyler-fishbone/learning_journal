## learned today
* more common protocols in use by the internet at large
* basics of building an http server using vanilla Python

## Thoughts
so... tired... have more work but cannot do... it's too much. sleep is more important. This shit is talking over. I've got good moments, but sometimes it's just too much.

Lab went fine. If I hadn't had a group of 6 people mobbing it it would have taken forever. The whiteboarding still took me a really long time.

I know I'll be able to make it through this course but I shutter to think about how ground down I'll be at that point.

## Gratitude
* passover was really nice today
* I've got a good group for the assignment
* a future in austin with liza  : )
* la croix
