oooooooooh boy do I like funcitonal programming??? I do! I really do. It's awesome. I've been annoyed with a bunch of things with the katas recently where they felt super unorganized, but functional programming seems to be the answer. I'm sure my zeal will wear off a bit, but after a week of not really understanding databases I was happy to have something click.

Good partner power hour speaker. She seemed like an awesome manager, I'd love to work under her.

Stephen today. Ugh. After the partner power hour about soft skills I found myself hoping I would never be on a team with him. There was zero grace in how he brought up his 'bug' with allie. I'm amazed she kep her cool with him. I can see myself saying something to him monday, we'll see...
