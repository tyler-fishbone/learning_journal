## Learned Today
* about the TCP/IP stack and layers of activity it represents
* how to use sockets to send messages between machines, using the TCP/IP protocol

## Thoughts
I'm not sure why but I am tired as f*&k. I'm at this brewery doing the reading project brainstorming assignment and I can hardly keep my eyes open. I refuse to go home until I finish though, I want to keep that place sacred tonight. No work there.

The HTTP stuff was pretty cool once we got it working, not really sure how the heck we ever would have found out about byte streams if it wasn't for meagan... Excited though to step it up to the next level. Can feel we're starting to get more building blocks.

The white boarind challenge was a mess. I spent half the time trying to figure out what the heck it was asking us to do. Really feeling like this is the first iteration of this class which isn't great.

## Gratitude
