## Learned today
* Django forms and form handling

## Thoughts
Good stuff today for Brandon and I. We were able to get the forms up and working. It's still not perfect as I know you can edit other people's photos info, but we got far.

Brandon showed me xcode and android studio and now I'm super amped to mess around with them. I would love to feel comfortable creating an app!
