## Today we learned

* Forms
* Event Listeners

## Thoughts

It submits! Muahahaha.

ok.

Got the form up and running to append instances of my cookie stand to my table on the sales.html page (which is rad). For the first time took less time than I thought it would to do those things. 2.25 hours instead of 3 hours.

I feel like I relied pretty heavily on Allie's demo work so I don't feel like the info is deeply set in my head. But seems like that's by design since it's the first day we're using it. 

Went a little deeper with the CSS on the form today and got it to looker nicer. I won't say I got it to look exactly how I intended, but it looks nicer. That's a start. It just going to take some patient time working with css to realy get this stuff to work the way I want. Maybe tonight I can do that since I've got some time.
