* Utilize good Git processes including a-c-p cycles

## LAB: 5 Questions and Git A-C-P 

Today I became a boss of git. Once I commit this README that will be 20 commits today. Github seemed from the first day I started learning to code like a confusing beast maze thing. Now it seems only confusing, a beast no longer.

I think I was committing a bit too much but I assume with time I will learn when it is and is not necessary.

I think overall the the 5 questions in javascript went well, I didn't really feel stuck any of the time. Things worked as Allie said they would.

I will say that I had a couple classmates ask me questions during the lab that clearly showed they were not listening. This half annoyed me and half made me feel like as long as I keep paying attention as I have then I'll be far ahead of the curve.

I'm still a bit sick which as well, while irritiating makes me feel excited that once I'm better I'll be even more energetic. For now coffee is filling that void.

My goal for this notebook is to write at least for 5 minutes a day in it. I'll set a timer and get going. It's a resolution I made anyway (to consistently reflect everyday) so it's really just convinient that it is required.

Here's a link btw (to test out how links work in md):

Again today I felt a bit bored and listless during the lecture (like what am I doing with my life) and then when i started coding the time started flying by : ) 
Not a rip on Allie either, I think when I'm sitting there in class I just start thinking about what it's going to be like sitting at a computer all day. But then when I start coding **aka actually sitting at a computer all day** I start to enjoy myself a lot. Which it rad.

Ok i know I'm way past my 5 minutes but it's the first day so w/e.
