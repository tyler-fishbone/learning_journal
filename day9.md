## Today we learned
* nothing specific, we went back over the assignment from yesterday
* more about the 401 courses

## Thoughts

The lecture earlier today wasn't too bad, I voted for going back over what we did yesterday, but now after having banged my head against the table about css for the last 4 hours I really wish I had voted on doing that instead.

I worked on my the cookie stand website to put the 6 pictures into it as well as add the locations. It took me forever to get it close and I really don't think i did it a good way. My CSS doc is a mess. The site looks good relative to other students' but I'm not satisfied personally with it.

The 401 panel was good. I didn't feel like I'd figured much out after it, but reflecting on it now I think it was minus points for javascript. The instructor didn't really resonate with me as much as the other 3, it made me think it would be easier to pick up javascript and node if I went python, c sharp, or java. The biggest thing I came away with though was the point that no matter what I do, I will without a doubt learn more languages as I move forward into my career. My first job may not even be in the language I study in. That's a huge relief as I don't feel I know what I want to do with this new skillset.

Excited for tomorrow's wireframing and help with CSS.
