## Thoughts
Today was our first real pair programming day of 301. Or for us, a tripair! Our assignment was to take a blog that already had much of the HTML, style it and give it a responsive menu.

I worked with Brent (new for our class) and Jose F. The assignment went alright. We got it done in the end but I didn't really feel like our pairing was particularly good. I felt I kind of sat around a bunch or was too directiony when I was on the keyboard. I think the group of 3 just doesn't work very well. I remember it happened once with forrest and steven and the same thing happened. While there is room for a couple people if you're working on a particular problem and want to talk it out, for long periods of time 3 people is just too many.

Brent's a smart guy though. It was my first time pairing with someone who I felt might know more than me which was cool. V happy I got to do that. It's good to work on my ego : )

Otherwise the jQuery stuff we are learning is **awesome!!!!**. It so effing powerful I can't believe it. I love the way we're being taught this stuff. We really now have an appreciation for the new tools we are being given. We understand how much work they are saving us!
