## thoughts
good lord, django is just the greatest. another day of adding significant functionality to our application with such little difficulty. I'm really happy to know coding isn't just pyramid and vanilla javascript. I was really getting worried.

the dats structures stuff is still feeling hard. not too hard but hard enough that I feel really pressed for time. I had to cite beverly's code today to figure out how the kary trees could work. I was overcomplicating it by a lot. After getting the k-ary trees much cleaner though with queues I feel way more ready for tonights whiteboard.

Glad to be able to get some sun time today : )
