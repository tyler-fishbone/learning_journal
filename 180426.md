## Learned Today
* how Django handles and accesses files
* signals and receivers in Django
* how Django handles static files in development vs production
* understanding of Django's templating tools and passing context

## Thoughts
Good day today. Almost sad I left a little early but being out in the sun was amazing and I was able to help out late tonight with that killer bug. Supe win on that side. 

Kind of hard to imagine when making a simple django application will ever feel not daunting, even with all the things it provides us. But I guess it's like speaking a language, once you learn a phrase or speech pattern, it grows your understanding of the language as a whole and you'll one day look back on that part as easy.

## Gratitude
* Sun baby, so much sun
* Brandon being rad
* The boat today, so nice!
* Sarah and Eric it feels so natural it's almost asexual, but hopefully not
* this weekend!
