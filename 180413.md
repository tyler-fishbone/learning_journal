## Thoughts

I'll admit it, today was a lot of fun and good work. I think a purposeful and devoted period of time to look at resumes was the only thing that was really going to make me do it.

My personal pitch went very well which I'm glad about and I think I made significant progress on the resume.

Now for the weeeee-heeee-heeeee-kend babeeeee
