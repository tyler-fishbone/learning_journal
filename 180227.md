## Thoughts
Oh to code again! How sweet it feels.

Today rocked. I was actually able to put on my headphones and bust out some code! Jeremy and I worked together, but split up the work between back end and front end for the day 1 of the book project and it worked great. We finished our stuff for today without too much trouble (minus CSS eek :/).

It just felt so good to be writing code again after spending a week filling in the blanks. Nice to see that feeling still exists. Also this Birocratic dude on spotify is rocking sox, super good.

I want to stay ahead like this, I think we can if we are diligent about the lab tomorrow and do prep tonight. We'll be switching the roles so Jeremy get's a chance to mess with front end stuff and I can jump on the backend more.

Another thing to notice is that today, for the first time at codefellows, we deployed a website with a front and backend that is available on the internet! That's a first! Woooooo! Hoooo! (can't forget the hoooo). Here's to more days like this.
