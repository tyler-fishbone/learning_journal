## Thoughts
another day, another lecture of this I don't have much grasp on. But fear not, it's ok. That is the beginning step of everything. I'm super amped to be in the backend finally. The syntax and code blocks are incomprehensible but one day they won't be. The important hing is that we're graduating into building real sites today.

I also had more breakthrough with feeling good about python. Amanda came in today about c# and I wansn't really into it. Afterwards I talked with some classmates and I realized that ths upcoming choice (absent some sort of super focused reason) really just comes down to what would I like to learn the rest of the fundamental concepts using. Python is super great to understand which rocks. Yeah it's not really Object Oriented, but I can learn that later. I'll get the foundational concepts here.

Jeremy asked me to be his partner for next week. I can see us butting heads a bit but he's a smart capable guy. I think we'd make an effective team. At least I know he can hold his own.
