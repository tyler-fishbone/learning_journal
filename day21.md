## thoughts
today it happened. I became ok with python as my choice for 401. I had a crisis after allie and vinicio said I should do C# but after talking with Josh and listening to Scott, and really realizing that I'm not going to be really learnin mobile with anything that I do, came to feel ok with python. It'll be rad to have a more backend focu. My patience about the appearance of things is quickly worn out.

The ajax stuff that we are learning is really exciting, although I definitely feel I don't yet grasp the awesome power of API. Just being able to pull stuff in doesn't seem that useful yet. I want interaction! I want the user to do things and have the pages remember it and do cool stuff back. But we've just touched the tip of the iceberg, it goes deep.

UI challenge was very easy. Couldn't gone further with it, but felt good to have a respite.
