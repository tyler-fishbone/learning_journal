## Learned today
* more about requests
* how to put backslashes in the right place

## Thoughts
* project soturned out pretty well. We got our book app working with admin access, updating it, deleting them, etc.. gotta be happy about that. Started with our groups and brainstorming ideas. I feel like APIs are going to be a huge part of my future, I love leveraging tools and attching things together. I just have to keep in mind that whatever we build for this project week will not be my life's work. It's the first of many project's so be easy.

Also got more excited about getting into python, there are so many things we can build with it. Totally forgot about hardware dev platforms like rasp pi!

Ok going to a movie.

## gratitude

* oh also that the hiring guy from splunk was nice, glad I perked up enough courage to talk to him
