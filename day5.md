## Thoughts

Today went well again. I was more excited about learning that you can return arrays from functions. That opens up a lot of functionality to them.

I turned in the about me page which is functioning super well. Not wild about my subpar css but it's not tooo bad. I can tell we'll really need to be made to do it in order to do a good job. Unlike the functional stuff I do not have a headstart on CSS.

The speaker today was really interesting. We've been in this little fun bubble here at CF and him coming in was a welcome pop. The topic wasn't my favorite, but in a way that I know that I know I improvement in that area will lead to a lot of growth. He really hammered home that a job is going to come from knowing someone. 

So to meetups I shall go, projects indeed I shall work on, make them public I shall.
