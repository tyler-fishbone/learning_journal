* fundamentals of data visualizations with the MatPlotLib package.
* basic understanding of how to approach data analysis through process and planning.

## Thoughts
I hate to say this because I don't want to encourage sadim but I feel fucking great. We are pushing ourself a lot and coming together as a group to get through it. Also I checked my grade and it was much better than I expected so that probably helps : )

Critiques are that TAs still need solution code! That one genre to gross ratio was dumb and if someone actually tried to solve it that would have been clear.

What is awesome is the working as individuals but working together. I'm having such a great time working with beverly, patricia, and brandon. It makes the assignments managable and way more fun.

The pandas stuff is slowing makingmore sense. I feel like I still struggle with really fundamental stuff like returning (eg graph directors with how many movies they've done). But he chaining syntax is starting to get clearer.

## Gratitude
* That I get my computer back soon!
* Miranda comes home in 3 days!!
* That I've got a fun group here. We're def gonna get close over the next 9 weeks.
