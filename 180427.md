## Thoughts Today

Rad day all around.

Got that bug late last night. Hash tables lecture was super interesting. I didn't realize how easy and understandable hashing could be, I'm gonna tackle that lab on sunday and I feel excited about diving into it. Also lab stuff today went really well in my opinion. I feel like I'm really starting to wrap my head about how information is passed between the different layers of our program. Again working with brandon is great.
