## Thoughts

Standing desks... that was my day... Wrote out a bunch of feelings about it here but decided to delete them. Instead here are some ideas.

* If professionalism to the outside world is an issue then we can not do it during the hours that tours are going on. Secret agent style.
* If marking up the table is a problem we can buy those felt sticker things and put them on the bottom.
* Buy 5 stands like steven's (which he claims to have bought for $25 on amazon) and see if students use them. Surely there is marketing value in showing the outside world that CF provides stuff like that to students.
* Big colored foam blocks or something like that to put on the desk to then set laptop on. Very tech. Very cool and trendy.
* I am commisioned to make a whole bunch of the 'walking desks' that are in that picture link below.

^ ^ ^ ^ ^ I made that walking desk 5 years ago to address this very problem (wish i still had it).


There must be a way!
