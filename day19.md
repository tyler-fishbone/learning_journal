## Thoughts
Josie and the pussycats I feel suuuuper strung out! That lecture went way too long. Combined with it being afternoon lectures I had the hardest time yet concentrating so far. I really did not expect these afternoon lectures to be as bad as they are, but I'm really feeling it.

The instructor panel was pretty good. I realized today that I just want Scott to give me a reason to go python. I want it, I just want him to show that it's going to be good, but he's so lax that next to brian (sp?) and amanda he just seems apathetic. But allie saying that he was a good teacher for her and similar made me realize that a chill teacher is not a bad thing. Plus she said that he is very clear and works hard for his students. That made me feel 1,000,000% better. Python I think it will be (though I'm my indicisive ass will draw it out as long as possible).

Sew. The lab with Dawn today was pretty good. I could really take the driver seat because she was trying to catch up, which I enjoyed mucho. The stuff we did was pretty interesting. But becuase of the way we're just doing these little code challenges inside the code I can tell that if I had to something from scratch I'd be like 'ooooo, em,.... how?' but that's ok, I know it's the whole firehose thing.

How can I not be in this strung out place tomorrow? It's affecting my personal life? Coffee at the break? Standing up at the final break? More water maybe? Maybe a snack! that could help. We'll see. I'll try some things.
