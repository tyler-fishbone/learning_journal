## Thoughts

Marika today was a lot. Just now 'finished' my lab, which really is like only 80-90%. Mucho.

But the job! Woah that really came out of nowhere. It's really funny. It's like my dream job 1 year ago. But it seems like it could be perfect for a little bit so I'm going to take tonight to prepare my 'duct tape' protfolio. It's really a great idea. I can tell this is going to go well because I feel the same way I did when I was negotiating in China. I don't need it but it would be great to have. Also I really can't think of a better implementation of ym skill set at this point. My only worry is that I would lose my coding skills by getting back on the physical maker side. But that is a good thing to bring up to them. That's what I want. To be doing a lot with coding. refuse to let this atrophy. That's why I'd really prefer a software job after this so I can keep growing. I'm worried this thing might now have any metnorship or 'hey can you help me with this code' outlets. That couuld be an issue.
